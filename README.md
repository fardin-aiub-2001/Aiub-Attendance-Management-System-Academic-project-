AIUB Attendance Management System was an academic project I developed for self-learning purposes. I designed and implemented nearly 100% of the frontend myself, using AI assistance only to resolve specific styling and property-related issues. For the backend, I relied on AI for approximately 80% of the development, as time constraints limited my ability to fully explore backend implementation during the academic term.
Although the application is complete and the project has been closed, I’m now planning to build a new version with the same core features—enhanced by advanced functionalities and more visually appealing design. This next iteration will focus on improved user experience, robust backend architecture, and modern UI aesthetics.
